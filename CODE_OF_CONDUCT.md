# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (ARKTIK Hybrid Edition)

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free, family-friendly experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, or religion.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. ARKTIK serves as a digital sanctuary, reflecting our commitment to providing a supportive and positive environment for all participants, rooted in traditional family values.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Any behavior that creates a non-family-friendly environment
* Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or sanctuary-like setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor whose behavior is deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, harmful, or disruptive to our digital sanctuary.

In addition to temporary bans, ARKTIK reserves the right to enforce *exile*—removal from the community with potential future re-entry consideration after remediation—and *permanent bans* for zero-tolerance violations that compromise the sanctity of our community environment. As a Web3 and faith-based hybrid nonprofit, we exercise our sovereign right to uphold and maintain this sacred community standard.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at support@arktik.solutions. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.  Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
